The assignment requires you to create a React Native mobile application with two main features:

Render Form from XML File: When the first button is clicked, the app should load a predefined XML file, parse it, and display a form based on the XML structure.
Render Form from XML Input: When the second button is clicked, the app should accept XML input from the user, parse it, and display a form based on this XML.


UI Development:

Create two buttons labeled "Render Form from XML File" and "Render Form from XML Input" on the main screen.
XML Parsing:

Use a library like react-native-xml2js or fast-xml-parser for parsing XML.
Implement functions to render various input fields based on XML tags (e.g., <textField>, <dateField>, <radioButton>, <drawingField>).
Form Rendering:

Develop components for each field type, and render them according to the XML structure.
Testing:

Test with different XML inputs to ensure all field types are handled correctly.
Error Handling:

Display user-friendly error messages for issues like invalid XML format.
